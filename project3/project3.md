# Homework 3 - Designing Cooperative Scheduler.
### Due: May 5th 2025, 11:55pm

##### GitHub page:
https://github.com/RutgersCSSystems/cs519-sp25/tree/main/project3/project3.md

Your goal would be to implement simple cooperative scheduling in the Linux OS.  

#### Part A - Understanding the Linux Scheduler CFS scheduler (15 points) In the
class, we discussed the basics of the CFS scheduler. In this project, we will
aim to understand the code internals of the CFS scheduler (part A), identify
ideas to improve the CFS scheduler (part B).

In the first part of the project (easier), you will try to understand the code
of the CFS scheduler and write a detailed description of:

	- How are tasks added to a per-CPU runqueue and which file maintains this information?
	- How are tasks scheduled on a CPU and which functions handle this?
	- How are tasks de-scheduled/preempted from a CPU?
	- How are queues re-balanced?
	- What are the data structures used for managing run-queues?
	- How the scheduler converts application specified nice values to priority.
	- How are the statistics of a task and process-level statistics
	  collected by the scheduler?
	- How  are the statistics exposed to userspace?

The deliverable for the first part of the project will be a detailed description
(i.e., code commentary) of the Linux scheduler code, which includes the
functions that are called and a description of what these functions do. You will
also discuss cases when the CFS scheduler fails to capture application idleness.
HINT: Application idleness includes any CPU core underutilized by an
application.


#### Part B - Changing CFS scheduler to be Co-operative (75 points)

1. Add a New System Call: Introduce a new system call or use the system call you
developed for projec 1 that allows application threads to convey their
inactivity to the scheduler. This system call should provide a mechanism for a
thread to notify the scheduler that it is not actively using CPUs.

2. Handle the System Call in the Scheduler: Modify the scheduler to handle the
newly added system call. When the system call is invoked, the scheduler should
collect information about the application, specifically using the TGID (Thread
Group ID) from the task_struct.

Here a simple incomplete system call. One suggestion is that it could be
implemented in kernel/sched/core.c but not necessarily this needs to be in this
file.

```
syscall_set_inactive(â€¦.)
{
    struct task_struct *task = current;  // Get the current task_struct
    // Mark the task as inactive in scheduler data structures
    task->inactive = 1;  // Assume a flag 'inactive' in the task_struct
    
    // ... (Additional logic for cooperative scheduling)
    
    return 0;  // Success
}

//Feel free to add your own signatures to these functions
static inline void check_preempt_inactive(struct task_struct *p, struct rq *rq, int flags)
{
    // Check if the task is inactive, and adjust scheduling accordingly
    if (p->inactive) {
        // Adjust scheduler behavior for inactive tasks
        // ... (Your logic for cooperative scheduling)
    } else {
        // Standard preempt logic for active tasks
        check_preempt_wakeup(p, rq, flags);
    }
}
```

3. Design a Multi-threaded Benchmark: Develop a simple multi-threaded benchmark
that engages all available cores by continuously spinning on a while() loop.
Within this loop, the application should perform either no operations or dummy
operations, such as simple vector addition.

4. Implement Cooperative Scheduling: When the application is deemed inactive,
execute the system call to inform the operating system about its reduced
priority. This step involves the application signaling the OS to lower its
priority, allowing other active applications to be prioritized over it.

5. Ensure NICE Values Remain Unchanged: Emphasize that NICE values for
applications should not be altered during this process. The focus is on
introducing cooperative scheduling without affecting the NICE parameters set
for individual applications.

6. Test with Shared Memory Matrix Application: Utilize the designed
multi-threaded benchmark alongside the shared memory matrix application from
Project 1. Ensure that the shared memory matrix application performs actual
work. Run both applications simultaneously, activating cooperative scheduling
for the benchmark with the while loop. Evaluate the performance impact of the
shared memory matrix application when it runs standalone.

7. Report Results: Document and report the results of your experiments.
Highlight any observed differences in performance when cooperative scheduling
is enabled for the multi-threaded benchmark compared to the traditional
behavior. If possible, draw comparisons with the yield() system call provided
by Linux and discuss any creative insights or unique findings.  For any queries
